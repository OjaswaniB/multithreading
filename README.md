Multithreading is the ability of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) to break a single process into multiple threads of execution and run them concurrently. An execution thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be independently managed by a scheduler, the abstraction responsible for determining when, where, and in what order threads are allowed to execute.

The Python code file measures the time taken for matrix multiplication using different number of threads. It utilizes multi-threading to parallelize the matrix multiplication process and generates a plot illustrating the relationship between the number of threads and the average time taken.

The graph of time taken vs the number of threads for a CPU typically shows decreasing time taken as the number of threads increases up to a certain point, usually around the number of physical cores (in this case, 4). After this point, adding more threads can lead to increased time taken due to overhead from managing additional threads, contention for shared resources like cache, and potential saturation of available CPU resources, leading to diminishing returns or even performance degradation. This phenomenon is known as "over-subscription."
